Unity Cookbook
==============

Unity Cookbook is an assortment of helpfully specific, re-usable C# scripts for use with the Unity 3D Game Engine. This repository does not contain a Unity project on its own, but instead hosts independent files you can use in your own projects. The Cookbook hopes to fill the niche between powerful, sophisticated library code and game-specific behaviors.
